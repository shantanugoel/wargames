Hint: Source seems to have no sanity checks in some places

Solution: the grep command is run without any input sanitization. We can terminate it with a ";" in the input box and run any other command. We searched the current dir but there wasn't anything interesting there. There was a tmp file but it wasn't readable. /etc/passwd doesn't have the password (and anyways even if it had, it'd have been a hash, not the password). We listed other dirs and came across /etc/natas_webpass/natas10. Bingo!
Running below command gives us the password
`;cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10`
